# Nobel_Prize_Winners

This is my submission to Datacamp's project [***A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners***](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/441).

Here we mainly try to visually explore nobel prize winners from different prespectives, i.e. age, major, timeline, gender, etc.

Hopefully it's not too late to win a nobel prize :)
